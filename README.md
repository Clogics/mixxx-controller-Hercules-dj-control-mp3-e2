Configuration files for Hercules DJ Control MP3 e2 under Mixxx 1.12
===================================================================


[Mixxx](http://mixxx.org) is a powerful cross-platform open source DJ software. With it, you can listen to your music, mix your tracks and much more. You can use dedicated MIDI controllers (hardware) to control Mixxx.

Version 1.12 of Mixxx is now in beta.

Here, you will find configuration files (xml MIDI mapping file and associated javascript file) for mixxx 1.12 to use the DJ Control MP3 e2 MIDI controller from Hercules. 

It extends the controller by using 2 levels of "shift", allowing to have 3 functions on each button/knob.
This mapping is 4-deck compatible and implements a deck switch. You can assign deck A to Channel 1 or 3 and deck B to Channel 2 or 4.

Installation
----------------

Simply drop the two files in your Mixxx controllers directory and select "Hercules DJ Control MP3 e2" as your controller in Mixxx controller preferences.
